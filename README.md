This repository is forked from the original (https://github.com/midstar/heatmiser_wifi_ha) and updated for my personal requirements only. Feel free to use it as is or clone 
and take over the responsibility for public maintenance.

## Overview
A [Heatmiser](http://www.heatmiser.com/) WiFi Thermostat Home Assistant plugin.

The original version supports:
* Read current air temperature
* Read/set temperature setting (i.e. wanted temperature)
* Read/set on/off of the Thermostat

The original version supports Heatmiser Thermostats are WiFi versions of DT, DT-E, PRT and PRT-E. 

This fork adds support for the PRT-HW WiFi thermostat, and adds the following functionality (for PRT-HW, maybe others):
* TBA 
* TBA

Note that non-WiFi thermostat versions (i.e. using RS-485 serial bus) 
connected through an Heatmiser Ethernet HUB are supported by the
[Home Assistant Heatmiser Core component](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/heatmiser/)
